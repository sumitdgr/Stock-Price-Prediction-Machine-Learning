# Stock-Price-Prediction-Machine-Learning
Machine learning algorithm to predict if the stock price will increase tomorrow.
If the algorithm says that the price will increase, we'll buy stock. If the algorithm says that the price will go down, we won't do anything.

Libraries used:
        1- yfinance
        2- Numpy
        3- Pandas
        4- scikit-learn
        
Steps to complete project :
        1- Download stock prices from Yahoo finance
        2- Explore the data
        3- Setup the dataset to predict future prices using historical prices
        4- Test a machine learning model
        5- Setup a backtesting engine
        6- Improve the accuracy of the model
